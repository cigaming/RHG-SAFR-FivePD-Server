# Loadscreen
 Simple, nice looking loadscreen.
 
 I've been working a few days on trying to figure out the best eye appealing loadscreen, but i could not figure it out.
 When i loaded a nice image, and just printed text on it, i thought to myself, HECK this is not fancy enough.
 so i put a layer over it, cut the image in half, and added some NIZ SPARKLEZ.
 

Nuff said.
In order to customize the logo, just open the logo with photoshop, or replace the logo.png (PNG cuz transparent background)

Then next step is to edit the text on the loadscreen to your own personal message.
This can be done in the index.html file, just make sure to only change the text, not the organization of it etc.. or it will mess it up.
```html
<div style="margin-top:10%"><a style="font-size:24px;font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Hey there! <br></br> RockfordRP is loading...</a></div>
