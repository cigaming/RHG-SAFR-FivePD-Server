  [ * ] Installation:
|
| 	1. drop the "ai_mechanic" folder into your resources.
| 	2. add the 'start ai_mechanic' line to your server.cfg file.
| 	3. Boot up the server and have fun!
|
|
|
 \
  [ * ] Usage:
|
| 	- This is a standalone script that doesn't require any sort of frameworks (e.g. ESX) or SQL.
| 	- It's recommended for use on smaller whitelisted servers, since it lacks permissions.
| 	- Keep in mind that the AI can be unpredictable in multiplayer, so expect to see some bugs!
|   - For configurations see config.lua
|
|	  - In order to call for the Mechanic, you need to either be facing a vehicle or sitting inside of it.
| 	- The default command for the Mechanic is /mechanic
|	  - Afterwards you will recieve a confirmation notification as well as a blinking yellow blip on your mini-map.
|	  - ( If you dont see the yellow blip, try again. ) 
|	  - Every time you type in /mechanic, your previous request will be cancelled, and the mechanic - removed.
