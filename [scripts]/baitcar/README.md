/lockbc (serverid) 

/unlockbc (serverid) 



WARNING:
Currently this script has no method of checking to see if the issuing player is "a cop" or not, 
you will need to add that part in to meet your needs as i don't feel like spending hours making this work with 10 different scripts.


INSTALL:
This is Standalone and uses no other scripts, just download it and throw it into your server's resources.
