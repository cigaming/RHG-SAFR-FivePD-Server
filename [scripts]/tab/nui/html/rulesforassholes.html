              This is the first and most important rule. You should be respectful to other players and administrators. You should always
              keep in mind that whatever you do in-game, it should not infringe on others' capacity to enjoy the game. this
              means not sending someone angry or offensive out-of-character messages because of an in-character subject or
              event. Also, do not argue with an administrator because you disagree with an administrative ruling. Please
              use the fill out a ticket in our website to deal with the issue privately. Furthermost NO TROLLING player,
              members, police, admin and etc.

            Killing another player for little or no in-character reason is strictly forbidden. Deliberately attempting to start a fight
            with little to no reason is also, not allowed. Going up to another player and insulting them in-character with
            the sole intention of escalating the situation to a fight is also not allowed without the proper roleplay scenario
            (bar fights, car accidents, etc.). There will be absolutely no RANDOM DEATH MATCHING OR VECHICLE DEATCH MATCHING.
            If a traffic accident has occurred while a player was hit by a car it need to be roleplayed out with ems and
            the police.

          <p>
            You are not allowed to seek out and/or kill anyone involved with your character's death. When you are killed, your character
            loses all memory leading up to and including their death unless they were rescued by paramedics. This may involve
            no longer knowing or recognizing your killer(s) after dying. You must also do your absolute best to avoid the
            player(s) who killed you, and definitely not kill them, provoke them, or otherwise engage them in any role play
            situation. If you are killed by a player, or a group of players, or the police you will forget everything involving
            your character and the opposing character(s) in that situation. If you are killed in an area that is not crucial
            to your character (house, or job), you should avoid the area to make a better roleplay for a while. This all
            also applies to any death even accidental.

          <p>
            Players cannot solely use the in-game mechanics to steal another player's vehicle whilst said vehicle is occupied. The situation
            must be role-played out between both parties. If your vehicle does not possess a license plate due to game mechanics,
            you may not roleplay that it has one anyway. Any vehicle purchased from the dealership that does not have a visible
            plate will be considered registered as a recreational vehicle. These vehicles are for off-road use only and must
            be towed to your destination of choice. If you are in possession of such a vehicle on city streets will you be
            subject to being pulled over and issues fines and an impound. 4.1 How to roleplay firearm damage 200-100 HP can
            be treated as damage to your vest 99-50 HP is to be treated as a flesh wounds. You should see a doctor to lower
            your risk of infection. 49-1 HP is to be treated as a center mass shot. You'll be moving slowly and can't walk
            far. You WILL need medical attention 0 HP You are incapacitated. You may barely move your arms, and speak in
            /low. You must remain in the same place to await medical attention. After ten minutes you will be deemed dead
            and may respawn. 4.2 How to deal with vehicle collisions You are to roleplay all damage dealt to your car. You
            are not to head on wreck into other vehicles (even lag slam head on ramming). If you head on wreck into a stationary
            object with your vehicle at a speed above 45 MPH, you will need to roleplay that that vehicle is disabled for
            that situation. And also roleplay any injuries you may have received in the accident. You must report any accident
            with over $1000 dollars of damage. Failure to do so may result in a fine being issued to you.

          <p>
            Communicating information that your character does not know to others, sharing information via chat, TeamSpeak, Discord or
            any other method, that other characters would not feasibly be able to see or otherwise interpret, sharing out-of-character
            information through an in-character medium, or taking in-character action based on information gained from an
            out-of-character source are all classified as metagaming. Only authorized legal organizations are permitted to
            use TeamSpeak & Discord for in-character communication. 5.1 Chat Box Rules You cannot use internet slang or unrealistic
            abbreviations in in-character chats, nor can you use symbols other than standard punctuation, except when appropriate
            (i.e. in-character emails, text messages, or other digital communication). You are not permitted to use languages
            other than English publicly, in-character or out-of-character, except common words for flavor purposes. Nonstandard
            punctuation (i.e. smileys or other constructs) is not permitted. To indicate a pause in conversation, you can
            use an ellipsis – “…” – and to indicate a sudden break in conversation, you can use a dash – “— “. Finally, only
            certain varieties of legal organizations are permitted to use TeamSpeak for in-character communication. All no
            game related chat is to be held in Out OF Character chat but typing /ooc "message to server here". If you need
            help please use the help channel in the chat. 5.3 In Character Live-Streaming Due to the complexities surrounding
            in character streaming, live in character streams are not permitted. Streaming is permitted, however cannot be
            treated as in character and use of information gained directly from a player's stream will fall under metagaming.

            You are not permitted to roleplay sexual acts, detailed acts of torture or dismemberment, cannibalism, or other extremely
            morbid activities without the express out-of-character consent of all participants. If you do end up getting
            permission, that permission can be withdrawn at any time. The roleplay must take place in private, far away from
            where any individuals who have not given their consent for this type of roleplay might innocently enter. If at
            any time you revoke your permission for Offensive Roleplay, or if it is being forced upon you without your permission
            being given, you may log out to avoid this roleplay. Please report alerting the administration team before you
            do so.

            Players have the right to ignore other players' out-of-character discussions if they wish, unless it is to ask why they were
            killed. However, players are not permitted to ignore administrators’ communication or rulings. Furthermore, do
            not avoid out-of-character communications with an administrator, administrators, avoid answering a player who
            asks you why you killed them and spam someone in order to avoid roleplaying with them simply because it doesn't

          8. Committing Crimes in Unrealistic Areas
        </div>
        <div class="info-description">
          <p>
            Committing any type of obvious crime in a conspicuous area (such as a bank, police station, hospital or any other obviously
            populated area) is forbidden. The following areas are considered unrealistic areas to commit a crime: All banks,
            scripted car dealerships, vehicle rental locations, police / sheriff stations, fire departments, hospitals, fish
            sell points, two pier fishing locations, the Los Santos International Airport, trucker depot, scripted tattoo
            parlors, scripted barber shops, scripted clothing stores, scripted plastic surgeons, and Legion Square. If someone
            has already committed a crime and the roleplay is taken to such an area, it may be acceptable. This means don't
            rob somebody standing in front of the bank, police station or hospital. Attempt to kidnap somebody in front or
            inside of a heavily populated area. Crimes committed outside of a safe zone with the sole intention of leading
            it into one will not be tolerated. We will allow crimes to continue if relocation into the safe zone itself is
            unavoidable, but attempts to abuse this will be met with swift punishment. Do not kidnap a player, subsequently
            leading them to Del Perro Pier to drop them off the edge. Don't kidnap a player and lead them to the airport
            to steal their plane. Do not kidnap a police officer to then demand they to release your car from the impound
            lot and etc.

            No player or organization is permitted to have “contract killing” as their sole focus. Specific players or members of organizations

            Conversely, you cannot buy a vehicle from somebody and then rob them after the fact. In the instance that you

        <div class="info-description">
          <p>
            There are countless situations where you could take part in somewhat obscure roleplay that would be beneficial to your character
            by providing them with a customized item. Examples such as: ⦁ Converting your vehicle's center console into a
            lockable safe to keep your narcotics secure during a delivery. ⦁ Removing your vehicle's license plate, and subsequently
            committing a series of crimes in attempt to foil police. ⦁ Modifying items of clothing to hide objects, such
            as a hidden compartment in your shoe, or having sewn a bag of drugs on the interior of your coat. These examples
            are not against the rules, and you will not face punishment for doing them, but it should be kept in mind that
            any RP similar to the examples above will require proof. If no proof is provided, your RP will be considered
            invalid. It is highly recommended that you take screenshots of any RP that involve beneficial items not currently
            supported by our script. We will happily allow players to take part in complicated RP, but please ensure you
            have proof, as these examples can be effortlessly fabricated to provide a quick get-out-of-jail free card. Please
            note that administrators reserve the right to void your RP if the provided proof isn't substantial. Before creating,
            purchasing, or obtaining a beneficial item, it's highly recommended that players contact an administrator to
            obtain approval for said item. Administrators reserve the right to deny requests or ideas for these items, as
            well as removing existing items should they find them unnecessary. Players should make an effort to not stray
            too far from what our script allows. If something is possible in real life, it does not mean it will be allowed
            in our server.
