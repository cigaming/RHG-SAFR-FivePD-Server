      <h1>LA Criminal Code</h1>
      <p>
        The justice system works as follows: If you are caught committing a crime or driving violation you have the option to pay
        the fine issued or serve the sentence issued right away. The sentence will be decided by the arresting officer based
        on the Criminal Code, situation and the offenders previous record. The accused has the option to fight the case by
        a jury of their peers providing they have somewhat of a case. If the case is lost the accused will be sentenced to
        double the time of the original sentence. This applies for criminal and driving offences. If you chose this route
        you will be placed on bail providing you have the correct amount of money for bail. While on bail you may be subject
        to conditions for your release (if your crime was driving related maybe you'll be banned from driving till your trial
        date, if it booze related maybe you can't drink, curfew, etc.) In order for fair trial there must be six people willing
        to sit and hear the case and evidence provided by the defendant and the officer on the case. The peers will make
        their judgement and a judge will make the finally call on the sentence. If the peers feel you're not guilty then
        your free to go. You are free to hire a lawyer at any point. If you accept the sentence at the time of arrest you
        may pay your fine on the spot or serve your jail time in the police station closest to you providing you've been
        charged with an offence that doesn't require prison. If prison time is required you time is to be spent in the boiling
        broke pen and your sentence time start after your admitted. Any sentence issued in the court will be served in the
        prison as well. Jail break outs are permitted as long as there are minimum two guards on duty watching the jail/prison
        in question. No road break outs are permitted. By failing roleplay by any order made by police or judge and not following
        roleplay you will be banned.

            as either a summary conviction or indictable offense with similar maximum jail sentences. Punishment Min $1000

            Any "culpable homicide" that does not meet the definition of murder is said to be manslaughter. Culpable homicide is defined
            to include when a person causes the death of another human being by: (a) by means of an unlawful act; (b) by
            criminal negligence; (c) by causing that human being, by threats or fear of violence or by deception, to do anything
            that causes his death; or (d) by willfully frightening that human being, in the case of a child or sick person.
            Manslaughter is reserved for killings where the level of intent is less than murder. Practically speaking, manslaughter
            is when someone is doing something wrong and someone else ends up dead as a result of it -and- the offender did
            not intend to kill or cause significant bodily harm that he knew may result in death. Eligible for parole after
            5 minutes Prison Punishment Min 7 minutes Prison time to max of 25minutes. Bail would be set between $50 000
