# Credits

This resource is an overhaul of the ESX_drugsellnpc resource by Ferreira312. However that resource is neglected and poorly coded. This resource was made possible by Vito, and made possible for public consumption by x0Z3ro0x. From here on out, anything that breaks (unlikely) will be fixed by myself (x0Z3ro0x) so please do not bug Vito for fixes. Post them here and I will fix it. Please make sure to give a thanks to Vito and enjoy the release everyone!
