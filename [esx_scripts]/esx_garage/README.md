# About esx_advancedgarage:
Advanced Garage system for ESX Servers

This Code has been completely re-worked. ESX Advanced Garage supports Cars, Boats, & Aircrafts. This Garage Script only takes into account the Vehicles Purchased in the Car/Boat/Aircraft Shop or any other Shop that sells Vehicles. Players can also go to the Pound to retrieve their Vehicle if its lost or Destroyed for a Fee. During a reboot all Vehicles go back to the Garage.

* [Added Wiki that has the Common Problems Fixed](https://github.com/HumanTree92/esx_advancedgarage/wiki/Bugs,-Questions,-Etc.)

2) Extract the .zip or Open the .zip.
3) Place `esx_advancedgarage` in your ESX Directory

# KNOWN BUGS:
* There is a Limit on how many Vehicles that can be in each garage. For me it was 36 Vehicles in the Car Garage but after that i couldn't pull anymore out. You can still buy more Boats & Planes if the Car Garage is at 36.
* It is Possible to Duplicate Vehicles but do note that if said Person Duplicates a Vehicle & takes 1 of them & sell thems the other one is useless & can NOT be stored or sold.
* When buying an Apartment or Private House in order for the Garage to show you MUST relog from the SERVER & come back. If you buy an apartment & it doesn't show up make sure you relog.
* Doesn't work well when using the Car Dealer Job.
* If you are having problems with the SQL from esx_vehicleshop try the SQL from here. If a problem with the SQL from here try esx_vehicleshop SQL. If still having problems please submit an issue.
