# jsfour-atm

##### Update:
The atm has been translated to English. The images however are still in swedish. I'm too lazy to replace them all. You can find the English versions on my [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wlzro3fc0soq9n5/AAC2kvnKwJIeldq2f4N1DPkOa?dl=0). There's also 2 versions of the money gif, Euro and Dollars.

### LICENSE
Please don't sell or reupload this resource.

### INFO
It takes about 5 seconds to withdraw money from the atm. If the player want to withdraw a lot of money it can visit the bank where you can specify a amount to withdraw.

### INSTALLATION
* Add it to the resources folder and rename the folder to **jsfour-atm**. Nothing else will work.
* Run the SQL file.

### IMPORTANT
You're not required to have ESX installed to be able to run this resource. But however, if you're not using ESX you'll have to edit the [server.js](https://github.com/jonassvensson4/jsfour-atm/blob/master/server/server.js) to be able to use the deposit/withdraw/transfer functions. If you have ESX installed you won't need to edit anything. Just make sure that you're starting my resource **after** es_extended.
